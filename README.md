# odin-recipes
This is the odin project for using our htaml knowledge to figure out how to
make a recipe website. Here we will be using the knowledge of basic sytanx
like setting up boiler plate code, headers, bodies, and other information.

We will also be using knowledge about anchor points and images to make the site
more traversable.
