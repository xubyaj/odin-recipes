        <p class="menu">It takes decades of experience to become a true master sushi chef. Since most of us don't have that kind of time to invest, I think we're probably better off trying to make things from the other side of the menu, like this easy sesame seared tuna and sushi bar spinach salad.</p>
        <p>Now that the weather is warming up, I can't think of a grilled meat main course that it wouldn't make a fantastic side dish for. Just be sure to toast your sesame seeds enough, and not chicken out like I do every time. I always worry about them getting too dark and bitter, and end up stopping one shade too light. While still delicious, it doesn't release as much of that amazing nutty flavor. That's something I'm going to continue to work on, but in the meantime, I really hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy! </p>
